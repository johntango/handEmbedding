# This is simple neural network with an input layer (4 words)
### one hidden layer of 2 nodes and a softmax output layer of 4 nodes
### The input is a one-hot vector of 4 words
### The weights to the hidden layer are 4x2 matrix 
### The output layer is a sum of the hidden layer outputs with softmax
### to calculate probabilities of each word
